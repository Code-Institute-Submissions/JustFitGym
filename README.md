Organisation:

CSS: I created three different files per each section, to simplify the style organisation. Since this is my first project, I found more convenient to split the styles in three files rather than having a main.css for everything.

- header.css
- body.css
- footer.css



@MEDIA QUERY: 
- Responsive Design: DESKTOP FIRST approach



- Personal Notes:
In this project, I preferred to avoid Bootstrap as long as possible since it's the first project. I wanted to learn how to use HTML and CSS getting any help with Bootstrap. Probably I will make many mistakes in my code because of this choise, but these mistakes will consolidate my knowledge. 
When I master HTML and CSS, then Bootstrap will be more than welcome.
