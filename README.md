# WEBSITE: 
This is a three pages example divided in:
    Home: Main page where you can see an example of homepage, many links are not working since is only an example of my first website
    The Gym: Page where you can see membership costs. Being an example, I didn't add links on each membership to redirect a customer to a book and payment webpage
    Contact Us: Simple page to contact the gym. The form is not working since I'm not using any backend code.


# CSS: 
I created three different files per each section, to simplify the style organisation. Since this is my first project, I found more convenient to split the styles in three files rather than having a main.css for everything.

- header.css
- body.css
- footer.css


# @MEDIA QUERY: 
- Responsive Design: DESKTOP FIRST approach

# Personal Notes:
In this project, I preferred to avoid Bootstrap as long as possible since it's the first project. I wanted to learn how to use HTML and CSS getting any help with Bootstrap. Probably I will make many mistakes in my code because of this choise, but these mistakes will consolidate my knowledge. 
When I master HTML and CSS, then Bootstrap will be more than welcome.
